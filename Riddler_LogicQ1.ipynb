    "\"At RoboPizza™, pies are cut by robots. When making each cut, a robot will **randomly (and independently) pick two points** on a pizza’s circumference, and then cut along the chord connecting them. If you order a pizza and specify that you want the robot to make exactly three cuts, **what is the expected number of pieces** your pie will have?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "In analyzing the specific case from the problem, that of estimating the expected number of slices (regions) resulting from three slices (chords) across the pizza (circle), Larant points out the following probabalistic insights:\n",
    "- The likelihood that two chords will begin or end at the exact same point along the circumference of the pizza is 0, allowing for arbitarily small pizza slices. \n",
    "- Any time chords intersect in circle, the intersection will involve exactly two chords. The probability of the case involving an intersection of three or more chords is equivalent to the probability of one end of the 3rd (and subsequent) occuring at an arbitrary points along the circle's circumference, which is 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Larant reframes the question using Euler's Formula for Simple Planar Graphs. A graph G is planar if it can be drawn in the plane in such a way that no two edges meet each other excet at a vertex to which they are both incident. Euler's formula relates the number of vertices, edges and faces (including the infinite face) of a planar graph. If n, m, and f denome the number of vertices, edges, and faces respectively of a connected planar graph, then:\n",

    "- The values $X_{i,j}$ are not mutually independent. This can be shown by imagining a circle with three chords, $a, b, c$, two ($a, b$) of which are parallel. If $X_{a,c} = 1$, it must be the case that $X_{i,j}$. Despite this, linearity of expectations still applies. \n",
